[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mklein994/weather.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mklein994/weather)

A command line tool to retrieve weather from https://darksky.net with options to format for [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks).

The graph is made using the [spark](https://github.com/aftertheflood/spark) font, so make sure you have that installed.
